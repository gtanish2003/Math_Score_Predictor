# Math Score Predictor
The "Math_Score_Predictor" is a machine learning project that aims to predict the scores of math exams for students. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about students, such as their gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course status, and their scores in reading and writing.The project likely involves data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. It then uses machine learning algorithms, such as regression or classification models, to train on the dataset and predict the math scores.
